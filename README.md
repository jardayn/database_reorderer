##Database Reordererererer

Some people want order in their Databases.  
Like for the last 2 columns to be Date_created and date_modified;  
 But after a while these dreams fade and they're stuck with an ugly unordered DB.  
 
 ##Come the DB Reorderer.
 
It's a glorified form.   

Clone it. Enter the directory  
Start the server

`` php -S localhost:8000``  
Go to localhost:8000

Enter your DB info.  
Enter the order of columns you want at the start and the end of your table.  

Click Submit. You will get a list of tables in the DB.  
You can delete which one's you don't want reordered.  

Then click submit again. And you'll get a list of queries that you need to run
to satisfy your OCD

If you break something It's not my fault.
